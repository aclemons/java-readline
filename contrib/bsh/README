To use JavaReadline with BeanShell, you must replace one class
(bsh.Interpreter) in bsh.jar and add another one (bsh.bshCompleter).

The sourcecode for both files is provided in this package. Just
compile both files and use the jar utility from the JDK. Note that the
1.2 version has an update flag (this makes things easier). With 1.1
you have to extract the whole archive, replace the given class files
and create the archive again.

(This readme was shamelessly stolen and modified with little more than
substitution tricks from the jpython mod for readline.)

Note: JPython is now Jython, and there have been
some changes, so the following does not fully apply
anymore. I will fix the description shortly.

To use JavaReadline with JPython, you must
replace one class (org.python.util.jpython) 
in jpython.jar and add another one 
(org.python.util.ReadlineConsole).

The sourcecode for both files is provided
in this package. Just compile both files and
use the jar utility from the JDK. Note that
the 1.2 version has an update flag (this makes
things easier). With 1.1 you have to extract
the whole archive, replace the given class files
and create the archive again.

Once the new jpython.jar is ready, you have to
set the property "python.console" in your JPython
registry to org.python.util.ReadlineConsole. As
an alternative, you can supply this value with the
"-Dprop=value" commandline option.

For release 0.7.0:
	- bugfix: setCompleter(null) crashed the virtual machine. Now, it sets
	  the completer back to default behaviour (filename completion)
	- native functions added:
	  o cleanupReadlineImpl() does a reset of the readline lib and the
	    terminal. Exported as 'void cleanup()' to the java user.
	  o getLineBufferImpl() returns the current line buffer. This is
	    usually needed within completers to access the _full_ line (the
	    completer only gets the last word). Exported as
	    'String getLineBuffer()' to the java user.
	- documentation: complete example for ReadlineCompleter interface;
	  better indented example for Readline. Added cleanup() in the example.
	- declare the 'UnsatisfiedLinkError' in the load() method for
	  documentation purposes.
	(all changes provided by Henner Zeller <H.Zeller@acm.org>)

    <H2>Introduction</H2>

    <p>Originally a private project with the focus on learning about
      the Java Native Interface (JNI), Java-Readline has turned into a
      collaborative work of many contributers. It is now hosted on
      Sourceforge. For details about the project, please visit the
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-readline/">main
	project page</a>.

    <H2>Description</H2>

    <p>Java-Readline is a port of GNU Readline for Java. Or, to be
      more precise, it is a JNI-wrapper to Readline. It is distributed
      under the LGPL.

    <p><strong>Although Java-Readline is distributed under the LGPL, the
      underlying Readline library is GPL code. The consequence is,
      that any program linking with Java-Readline+Readline, will fall
      under the GPL.</strong>

    <p>There is a Readline replacement called Editline with a more
      liberal license. Starting with version 0.6, you 
      have the choice of linking against Editline. This version also
      features a fallback solution (System.in) for platforms without
      Readline or Editline support, making your programs portable
      again.

    <P>The code should compile for every platform supporting the readline,
      history and termcap libraries. Platforms known to work:
      <ul>
        <li>Linux (various x86-distributions)</li>
        <li>Solaris</li>
    </ul>
    Please let me know of any additional platforms you managed to make
    Java-Readline work on.

    <H2>Download</H2>

    <p>Various packages are available for download. See the <a
       href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48669">download
       area</a> of the Java-Readline project. The current version is
      <strong>0.7.3</strong>.

    <H2>Projects using Java-Readline</H2>

    <p>A number of projects use Java-Readline (or can be modified
      easily to use it):
      <ul>
      <li><a href="www.jython.org">Jython</a>, a Java-based
	implementation of Python (see the
	instructions in the README in the <em>contrib/jpython</em>
	subdirectory of the source-distribution of Java-Readline)
      <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/henplus/">HenPlus</a>,
	a JDBC-SQL-Shell.
      <li><a href="www.beanshell.org">BeanShell</a>, see the
	<em>contrib/bsh</em> subdirectory of the source-distribution
	of Java-Readline
    </ul>

    <p>If your project is missing, just drop me a note.

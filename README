This is my "port" of GNU-Readline to Java. Actually, it is a crude wrapper 
using the Java Native Interface (JNI).

This version implements basic readline functionality like line editing and
filename completion, which should be just enough for normal use. More specific
readline functionality like custom completers (if you don't know what it is
you don't need it) might be implemented in a future version (as soon as I
figure out what has to be done).

COMPILATION
===========

Compilation should be no problem. Try "make all". You should set the
variable JAVA_HOME (or edit the makefile). Also, if you don't use jikes,
you should change the variables JAVAC and JAVAC_OPT in the makefile. A better
alternative is to install jikes, it will speed up your development by
a factor of 2-3.

INSTALLATION
============

Copy the file libJavaReadline.so to one of your library directories or add
the directory where you put libJavaReadline.so to LD_LIBARY_PATH. Also, add
java_readline.jar to your CLASSPATH. After building the jar and the shared
library, you can run a program with something like:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib java -cp java_readline.jar org.foo.bar.MyClass

assuming that you put libJavaReadline.so into /usr/lib.

If you think you found a bug or want to contribute a version (a different
makefile should do) for one of Bill's operating systems (a different
makefile should do) please drop me a note.

This is my "port" of GNU-Readline. Actually, it is a crude wrapper using the 
Java Native Interface (JNI). It requires a shared library libJavaReadline.so
in your library search path LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

This version implements basic readline functionality like line editing and
filename completion, which should be just enough for normal use. More specific
readline functionality like custom completers (if you don't know what it is
you don't need it) might be implemented in a future version (as soon as I
figure out what has to be done).

See the file INSTALL for details about compiling and installing the wrapper
code.

If you think you found a bug or want to contribute a version (a different
makefile should do) for one of Bill's operating systems please drop me a 
note.

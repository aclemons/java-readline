This is my "port" of GNU-Readline to Java. Actually, it is a crude wrapper 
using the Java Native Interface (JNI).

This version implements basic readline functionality like line editing and
filename completion, which should be just enough for normal use.

Various people contributed code (see the file ChangeLog for details).
Since I changed some of the code, all bugs are my fault and bugreports
should be adressed to me.

The binary distribution contains the API documentation, a JAR with the
Readline class and the shared library libJavaReadline.so. It was compiled
running Linux 2.2.18 with glibc 2.2.

The source distribution contains all the source (I hope this doesn't surprise
you ;-) and a system of makefiles. You need the JDK to compile it.


LICENSING ISSUES
================

Although JavaReadline is distributed under the LGPL, the underlying
Readline library is GPL code. The consequence is, that any program
linking with JavaReadline+Readline, will fall under the GPL.

There is a Readline replacement called Editline with a more liberal
license. In a future version of JavaReadline, you will have the choice
of linking against Editline. This version should be available end of
October 2001 latest. That version will also feature a fallback
solution (System.in) for platforms without Readline or Editline support,
making your programs portable again.

I could not succeed to find the "official" source of Editline. There
is a "dead" project at sourceforge. The code I got hold of is rather
old and only implements basic readline and history functionality.
JavaReadline currently uses far more than Editline provides.

I would be grateful to anyone pointing me to the current maintainer
of Editline and/or a source for a current version of the code.

COMPILATION
===========

Compilation should be no problem. Try "make all". You should set the
variable JAVA_HOME (or edit the makefile). Also, if you don't use jikes,
you should change the variables JAVAC and JAVAC_OPT in the makefile. A better
alternative is to install jikes, it will speed up your development by
a factor of 2-3.

INSTALLATION
============

Copy the file libJavaReadline.so to one of your library directories or add
the directory where you put libJavaReadline.so to LD_LIBARY_PATH. Also, add
java_readline.jar to your CLASSPATH. After building the jar and the shared
library, you can run a program with something like:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib java -cp java_readline.jar org.foo.bar.MyClass

assuming that you put libJavaReadline.so into /usr/lib.

If you think you found a bug or want to contribute some code please drop 
me a note.

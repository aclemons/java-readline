The distribution contains the files Readline.class and libJavaReadline.so
(compiled with libc.so.5.4.46) for Intel-Linux. If this is good for you,
just copy Readline.class to  .../gnu/readline/Readline.class with the
directory gnu/readline relative to a directory in your CLASSPATH and copy
libJavaReadline.so to a directory in your library search path (usually
/usr/lib).

If you are using a different platform, make sure it supports gcc and the
readline, history and termcap library (if there is a port of bash, this
should be OK). Edit the makefile variables at the beginning of the makefile
(java compiler, target directory for class files, directory of include files)
and run make. Then follow the above instructions. That's it!

If you think you found a bug or want to contribute a version (a different
makefile should do) for one of Bill's operating systems please drop me a 
note.
